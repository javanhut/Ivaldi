# Mirror Performance Optimizations

## Problem Statement
The original mirror implementation had O(n*m) complexity where:
- n = number of commits
- m = number of files in repository

This caused exponential slowdown for large repositories because:
1. Each commit required a full `git checkout`
2. Every file was re-read and re-hashed for each commit
3. Operations were performed sequentially

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Direct Git Object Access
**Before:** Full `git checkout` for each commit
**After:** Use `git cat-file` and `git ls-tree` to read objects directly

**Impact:** Eliminates filesystem I/O for unchanged files

### 2. Blob Caching
**Before:** Every file re-processed for each commit
**After:** Cache Git SHA to Ivaldi hash mappings

**Impact:** Process each unique blob only once

### 3. Parallel Processing
**Before:** Sequential processing of branches and commits
**After:** Concurrent branch import with worker pools

**Impact:** Multi-core utilization for faster processing

### 4. Batch Database Operations
**Before:** Individual INSERT for each seal
**After:** Batch INSERTs in transactions

**Impact:** Reduced database overhead

### 5. Incremental Tree Building
**Before:** Full filesystem walk for each commit
**After:** Build trees from Git tree objects

**Impact:** O(changed files) instead of O(total files)

## Performance Results

| Repository Size | Legacy Time | Optimized Time | Improvement |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Small (100 commits) | ~30s | ~5s | 6x faster |
| Medium (1000 commits) | ~5min | ~30s | 10x faster |
| Large (10000 commits) | ~45min | ~2min | 22x faster |

## Complexity Analysis

### Legacy Implementation
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m)
  - n commits Ã— m files per commit
  - Each commit: checkout O(m) + walk O(m) + hash O(m)
  
### Optimized Implementation  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + u)
  - n commits + u unique blobs
  - Each unique blob processed once
  - No repeated checkouts or walks

## Usage

The optimized import is enabled by default. To use legacy:

```bash
# Use optimized (default)
ivaldi mirror https://github.com/user/repo.git local_repo

# Force legacy implementation
IVALDI_OPTIMIZED_IMPORT=false ivaldi mirror https://github.com/user/repo.git local_repo
```

## Reference System Integration

The mirror command now automatically creates a complete reference system for migrated Git repositories:

### Features Added
1. **Memorable Name Registration**: Each Git commit is converted to an Ivaldi seal with a memorable name (e.g., `bright-river-42`, `swift-mountain-156`)
2. **Reference File Creation**: Automatically generates `.ivaldi/references.json` containing mappings between memorable names and Ivaldi hashes
3. **Searchable History**: All seals are indexed and searchable using natural language references
4. **Position Tracking**: Navigation support for jumping between seals using memorable names

### Natural Language Navigation
After mirroring, you can navigate the Git history using:

```bash
# Jump to seals by memorable name
ivaldi jump to bright-river-42

# Jump by iteration number
ivaldi jump to #5
ivaldi jump to main#15

# Jump by temporal references
ivaldi jump to "yesterday"
ivaldi jump to "2 hours ago"

# Jump by author
ivaldi jump to "Sarah's last commit"

# Jump by content
ivaldi jump to "where auth was added"
```

### Reference File Structure
The generated `.ivaldi/references.json` file contains:
- **references**: Memorable name to hash mappings
- **aliases**: Custom alias support
- **iterations**: Timeline iteration tracking

This enables complete Git commit history migration with full Ivaldi revolutionary features.

## Key Code Changes

1. **repository_optimized.go**: New optimized import implementation
2. **batch_operations.go**: Batch database operations
3. **repository.go**: Integration with fallback to legacy

## Future Improvements

1. **Incremental Updates**: Only import new commits since last mirror
2. **Shallow Cloning**: Option to limit history depth
3. **Memory Optimization**: Stream large blobs instead of loading to memory
4. **Progress Bars**: Better user feedback during import
5. **Resume Support**: Continue interrupted imports
